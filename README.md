The origins of dosa arenâ€™t exactly known, and to this day, it is under contention. The author T K Acharya states that dosa was around in the first century AD in his book The Story of Our Food, backed up by references in Sangam literature. However, the historian P Thankappan Nair believes that it is from the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka, propelled by the fact that Udupi restaurants have become ubiquitous with selling dosa today. Regardless of its origins, the dosa was much softer and thicker than the crispy and thin dish we are accustomed to eating today. A recipe for dosa (written as dosaka) has been found in Manasollasa, a Sanskrit encyclopedia created by the ruler of the area at the time, Someshvara III. After India regained its independence, South Indian cuisine and dosa started to spread and began to take precedence across the world.
