Savory Dosas Recipe (South Indian Pancakes) ingredients 

Wash the rice and urad daal well and drain. Add the fenugreek seeds to the mix and add enough water to the bowl to cover the mixture by about 2 inches. Soak overnight.

Soaking rice and daal for dosas

The next morning, drain all the water from the rice mixture. Add to a high-speed blender and process—adding 1 3/4 cups ice-cold water—until a smooth yet slightly grainy paste has formed.

Transfer to a large mixing bowl and gradually add another cup of water to make a batter. The consistency of the batter should be such that it thinly coats a spoon dipped in it.

Add salt (or salt to taste) and keep the dosa batter aside in a warm, dark spot, covered, for 12 to 24 hours. After this fermentation, stir the batter well. It will have thickened to coat a spoon thickly. It is now ready to make dosas.

Dosa batter in a bowl, covered with a towel 

Put some ghee or oil in a small bowl and keep ready. You will also need a small bowl of ice-cold water, a large, flat nonstick pan, paper towels, a ladle, a spatula, and a basting brush.

Utensils and ingredients for cooking the dosa 
Fold 1 sheet of paper towel into a thick rectangle and dip lightly into the bowl of ghee or oil. Squeeze out any excess and then rub the paper towel all over the surface of the pan to lightly grease. The ghee or oil should barely be visible in the pan. Turn on the heat to medium-high.

Grease the skillet 
Add a scant ladleful of batter to the center of the pan, much like you would for a pancake.

Begin to spread the batter in sweeping circular motions to form a pancake of roughly 8-inch diameter. Do not be alarmed if the dosa develops tiny holes as you spread the batter. This is normal.

Swirling dosa batter in a pan
As soon as you have finished spreading the batter out on the pan, dip the basting brush in ghee and drizzle all over the surface of the dosa and around its edges. Hold the pan by its handle, lift it up, and swirl it so that the drizzled ghee spreads all over the dosa.​

Brush dosa with ghee 
Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, or until the upper surface begins to look cooked (it will no longer look soft or runny).

Then, flip the dosa. By this time, the surface that was underneath should be light golden in color. Cook for 1 minute after flipping.

A dosa cooked to a light golden color 
The dosa is almost done. Fold it in thirds like a parcel and allow to cook for 30 seconds more.

Folded dosa in a pan
Before you start making the next dosa, fold another sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip it in ice-cold water. Squeeze to remove excess water and then rub it all over the surface of the pan to cool it slightly. This ensures your next dosa will spread evenly and not break because the pan is too hot.

Clean the surface of the pan with a paper towel 
Repeat until you've used all of the batter.
